Title: Summary Tables and Plots for Statistical Models and Data: Beautiful,
    Customizable, and Publication-Ready 
Description: Create beautiful and customizable tables to summarize several
    statistical models side-by-side. Draw coefficient plots, multi-level
    cross-tabs, dataset summaries, balance tables (a.k.a. "Table 1s"), and
    correlation matrices. This package supports dozens of statistical models,
    and it can produce tables in HTML, LaTeX, Word, Markdown, PDF, PowerPoint,
    Excel, RTF, JPG, or PNG. Tables can easily be embedded in 'Rmarkdown' or 
    'knitr' dynamic documents.
