`datasummary` is a function from the `modelsummary` package. It allows us to create data summaries, frequency tables, crosstabs, correlation tables, balance tables (aka "Table 1"), and more. It has many benefits:

* Easy to use.
* *Extremely* flexible.
* Many output formats: HTML, LaTeX, Microsoft Word and Powerpoint, Text/Markdown, PDF, RTF, or Image files.
* Embed tables in `Rmarkdown` or `knitr` dynamic documents.
* [Customize the appearance of tables](#customize) with the `gt`, `kableExtra` or `flextable` packages. The possibilities are endless!

This tutorial will show how to draw tables like these (and more!):

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(modelsummary)
library(kableExtra)
options(width = 120)
```

# Background

`datasummary` is built around the *fantastic* [`tables` package for `R`.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tables/index.html) It is a thin "wrapper" which adds convenience functions and arguments; a user-interface consistent with `modelsummary`; cleaner html output; and the ability to export tables to more formats, including [`gt` tables](https://gt.rstudio.com), [`flextable` objects](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/), and Microsoft Word documents.

`datasummary` is a general-purpose table-making tool. It allows us to build (nearly) any summary table we want by using [simple 2-sided formulae.](#datasummary) For example, in the expression `x + y ~ mean + sd`, the left-hand side of the formula identifies the variables or statistics to display as rows, and the right-hand side defines the columns. Below, we will see how variables and statistics can be "nested" with the `*` operator to produce tables like the ones above.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(modelsummary)
library(tidyverse)

cap <- 'Penguin flipper lengths (mm) by location, species, and sex. This table was created using the \\texttt{datasummary} function from the modelsummary package for R.'
src <- 'Data source: Gorman, Williams & Fraser (2014) and  palmerpenguins package by @apreshill and @allison_horst.'
url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/palmerpenguins/penguins.csv'
penguins <- read.csv(url) %>%
            select(Species = species,
                   Island = island,
                   Sex = sex,
                   `Flipper length (mm)` = flipper_length_mm) %>%
            mutate(Sex = str_to_title(Sex))
datasummary(Factor(Island) * Factor(Species) ~ Factor(Sex) * `Flipper length (mm)` * (Mean + SD) * DropEmpty(), penguins,
           title = cap,
           notes = src)
```

In addition to `datasummary`, the `modelsummary` package includes a "family" of companion functions named `datasummary_*`. These functions facilitate the production of standard, commonly used tables. This family currently includes:

* `datasummary()`: Flexible function to create custom tables using 2-sided formulae.
* `datasummary_balance()`: Group characteristics (e.g., control vs. treatment)
* `datasummary_correlation()`: Table of correlations.
* `datasummary_skim()`: Quick summary of a dataset.
* `datasummary_df()`: Create a table from any dataframe.
* `datasummary_crosstab()`: Cross tabulations of categorical variables.

In the next three sections, we illustrate how to use `datasummary_balance`, `datasummary_correlation`, `datasummary_skim`, and `datasummary_crosstab`. Then, we dive into `datasummary` itself to highlight its ease and flexibility.

# `datasummary_skim`

The first `datasummary` companion function is called `datasummary_skim`. It was *heavily* inspired by one of my favorite data exploration tools for `R`: the [`skimr` package.](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr) The goal of this function is to give us a quick look at the data.

To illustrate, we download data from the cool new [`palmerpenguins` package](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) by Alison Presmanes Hill and Allison Horst. These data were collected at the Palmer Station in Antarctica by Gorman, Williams & Fraser (2014), and they include 3 categorical variables and 4 numeric variables.

```{r}
library(modelsummary)
library(tidyverse)

url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/palmerpenguins/penguins.csv'
penguins <- read.csv(url)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins$X <- NULL
```

To summarize the numeric variables in the dataset, we type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datasummary_skim(penguins)
```

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987057/95397127-6d9a9880-08d0-11eb-8ee4-3cd181d55b32.png" width="69%">

To summarize the categorical variables in the dataset, we type:

```{r}
datasummary_skim(penguins, type="categorical")
```

Later in this tutorial, it will become clear that `datasummary_skim` is just a convenience "template" built around `datasummary`, since we can achieve identical results with the latter. For example, to produce a text-only version of the tables above, we can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datasummary(All(penguins) ~ Mean + SD + Histogram,
            data = penguins,
            output = 'markdown')
```

```
|                  |    Mean|     SD|  Histogram|
|:-----------------|-------:|------:|----------:|
|bill_length_mm    |   43.92|   5.46|  ▁▅▆▆▆▇▇▂▁|
|bill_depth_mm     |   17.15|   1.97| ▃▄▄▄▇▆▇▅▂▁|
|flipper_length_mm |  200.92|  14.06|  ▂▅▇▄▁▄▄▂▁|
|body_mass_g       | 4201.75| 801.95| ▁▄▇▅▄▄▃▃▂▁|
```

Note that the `histogram` argument of the `datasummary_skim` function is `FALSE` by default, because printing histograms will not work on all computers. If you have issues with this option, try changing your computer's locale, or try using a different display font.

# `datasummary_correlation`

The `datasummary_correlation` accepts a dataframe or tibble, it identifies all the numeric variables, and calculates the correlation between each of those variables:

```{r}
datasummary_correlation(mtcars)
```

The values displayed in this table are equivalent to those obtained by calling: `cor(x, use='pairwise.complete.obs')`.

# `datasummary_balance`

The expressions "balance table" or "Table 1" refer to a type of table which is often printed in the opening pages of a scientific peer-reviewed article. Typically, this table includes basic descriptive statistics about different subsets of the study population. For instance, analysts may want to compare the socio-demographic characteristics of members of the "control" and "treatment" groups in a randomized control trial, or the flipper lengths of male and female penguins. In addition, balance tables often include difference in means tests.

To illustrate how to build a balance table using the `datasummary_balance` function, we download data about a job training experiment studies in Lalonde (1986). Then, we clean up the data by renaming and recoding a few variables.

```{r}
# Download and read data
training <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/Treatment.csv'
training <- read.csv(training)

# Rename and recode variables
training <- training %>%
            mutate(`Earnings Before` = re75 / 1000,
                   `Earnings After` = re78 / 1000,
                   Treatment = ifelse(treat == TRUE, 'Treatment', 'Control'),
                   Married = ifelse(married == TRUE, 'Yes', 'No')) %>%
            select(`Earnings Before`,
                   `Earnings After`,
                   Treatment,
                   Ethnicity = ethn,
                   Age = age,
                   Education = educ,
                   Married)
```

Now, we execute the `datasummary_balance` function. If the `estimatr` package is installed, `datasummary_balance` will calculate the difference in means and test statistics.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
caption <- 'Descriptive statistics about participants in a job training experiment. The earnings are displayed in 1000s of USD. This table was created using the "datasummary" function from the "modelsummary" package for R.'
reference <- 'Source: Lalonde (1986) American Economic Review.'

library(modelsummary)
datasummary_balance(~Treatment,
                    data = training,
                    title = caption,
                    notes = reference)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
caption <- 'Descriptive statistics about participants in a job training experiment. Earnings are displayed in 1000s of USD. This table was created using the datasummary function from the modelsummary package for R.'
reference <- 'Source: Lalonde (1986) American Economic Review.'

library(modelsummary)
library(kableExtra)
datasummary_balance(~Treatment,
                    data = training,
                    title = caption,
                    notes = reference,
                    output = 'kableExtra') %>%
  row_spec(5, bold = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(1, color = 'green') %>%
  row_spec(2, color = 'red')

```

Note that if the dataset includes columns called "blocks", "clusters", or "weights", this information will automatically be taken into consideration by `estimatr` when calculating the difference in means and the associated statistics.

# `datasummary_crosstab`

A cross tabulation is often useful to explore the association between two categorical variables.

```{r}
library(modelsummary)
url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/palmerpenguins/penguins.csv'
penguins <- read.csv(url)

datasummary_crosstab(species ~ sex, data = penguins)
```

You can create multi-level crosstabs by specifying interactions using the `*` operator:

```{r}
datasummary_crosstab(species ~ sex * island, data = penguins)
```

By default, the cell counts and row percentages are shown for each cell, and both row and column totals are calculated. To show cell percentages or column percentages, or to drop row and column totals, adjust the `statistic` argument. This argument accepts a formula that follows the `datasummary` "language". To understand exactly how it works, you may find it useful to skip to the `datasummary` tutorial in the next section. Example:

```{r}
datasummary_crosstab(species ~ sex,
                     statistic = 1 ~ Percent("col"),
                     data = penguins)
```


See `?datasummary_crosstab` for more details.

# `datasummary`

`datasummary` tables are specified using a 2-sided formula, divided by a tilde `~`. The left-hand side describes the rows; the right-hand side describes the columns. To illustrate how this works, we will again be using the [`palmerpenguins dataset`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/):

To display the `flipper_length_mm` variable as a row and the `mean` as a column, we type:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Mean,
            data = penguins)
```

To flip rows and columns, we flip the left and right-hand sides of the formula:

```{r}
datasummary(Mean ~ flipper_length_mm,
            data = penguins)
```

## Custom summary functions

The `Mean` function is a shortcut supplied by `modelsummary`, and it is equivalent to `mean(x,na.rm=TRUE)`. Since the `flipper_length_mm` variable includes missing observation, using the `mean` formula (with default `na.rm=FALSE`) would produce a missing/empty cell:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ mean,
            data = penguins)
```

`modelsummary` supplies these functions: `Mean`, `SD`, `Min`, `Max`, `Median`, `P0`, `P25`, `P50`, `P75`, `P100`, `Histogram`, and a few more (see the package documentation).

Users are also free to create and use their own custom summaries. Any `R` function which takes a vector and produces a single value is acceptable. For example, the `Range` functions return a numerical value, and the `MinMax` returns a string:

```{r}
Range <- function(x) max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)

datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Range,
            data = penguins)

MinMax <- function(x) paste0('[', min(x, na.rm = TRUE), ', ', max(x, na.rm = TRUE), ']')

datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ MinMax,
            data = penguins)
```

## Concatenating with `+`

To include more rows and columns, we use the `+` sign:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins)
```

Sometimes, it can be cumbersome to list all variables separated by `+` signs. The `All()` function is a useful shortcut:

```{r}
datasummary(All(penguins) ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins)
```
By default, `All` selects all numeric variables. This behavior can be changed by modifying the function's arguments. See `?All` for details.

## Nesting with `*`

`datasummary` can nest variables and statistics inside categorical variables using the `*` symbol. When applying the the `*` operator to factor, character, or logical variables, columns or rows will automatically be nested. For instance, if we want to display separate means for each value of the variable `sex`, we use `mean * sex`:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ mean * sex,
            data = penguins)
```

We can use parentheses to nest several terms inside one another, using a call of this form: `x * (y + z)`. Here is an example with nested columns:

```{r}
datasummary(body_mass_g ~ sex * (mean + sd),
            data = penguins)
```

Here is an example with nested rows:

```{r}
datasummary(sex * (body_mass_g + flipper_length_mm) ~ mean + sd,
            data = penguins)
```

The order in which terms enter the formula determines the order in which labels are displayed. For example, this shows `island` above `sex`:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ mean * island * sex,
            data = penguins)
```

This shows `sex` above `island` values:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ mean * sex * island,
            data = penguins)
```

By default, `datasummary` omits column headers with a single value/label across all columns, except for the header that sits just above the data. If the header we want to see is not displayed, we may want to reorder the terms of the formula. To show all headers, set `sparse_header=FALSE`:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ mean * sex * island,
            data = penguins,
            sparse_header = FALSE)
```

When using `sparse_header=FALSE`, it is often useful to insert `Heading() *` in the table formula, in order to rename or omit some of the labels manually. Type `?tables::Heading` for details and examples.

## Renaming with `=`

Personally, I prefer to rename variables and values *before* drawing my tables, using backticks when variable names include whitespace. For example,

```{r}
tmp <- penguins %>%
       select(`Flipper length (mm)` = flipper_length_mm,
              `Body mass (g)` = body_mass_g)

datasummary(`Flipper length (mm)` + `Body mass (g)` ~ Mean + SD,
            data = tmp)
```

However, thanks to the `tables` package, `datasummary` offers two additional mechanisms to rename. First, we can wrap a term in parentheses and use the equal `=` sign: `(NewName=OldName)`:

```{r}
datasummary((`Flipper length (mm)` = flipper_length_mm) + (`Body mass (g)` = body_mass_g) ~
            island * ((Avg. = Mean) + (Std.Dev. = SD)),
            data = penguins)
```

Second, we can use the `Heading()` function:

```{r}
datasummary(Heading("Flipper length (mm)") * flipper_length_mm + Heading("Body mass (g)") * body_mass_g ~ island * (Mean + SD),
            data = penguins)
```

The `Heading` function also has a `nearData` argument which can be useful in cases where some rows are nested but others are not. Compare the last row of these two tables:

```{r}
datasummary(sex * (flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm) + Heading("Body mass (g)") * body_mass_g ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins)

datasummary(sex * (flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm) + Heading("Body mass (g)", nearData=FALSE) * body_mass_g ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins)
```


## Counts and Percentages

The `tables` package allows `datasummary` to use neat tricks to produce frequency tables:

1. Add a `N` to the right-hand side of the equation.
2. Add `Percent()` to the right-hand side to calculate the percentage of observations in each cell.
3. Add `1` to the left-hand side to include a row with the total number of observations:

```{r}
datasummary(species * sex + 1 ~ N + Percent(),
            data = penguins)
```

Note that the `Percent()` function accepts a `denom` argument to determine if percentages should be calculated row or column-wise, or if they should take into account all cells.

## `Factor`

The `*` nesting operator that we used above works automatically for factor, character, and logical variables. Sometimes, it is convenient to use it with other types of variables, such as binary numeric variables. In that case, we can wrap the variable name inside a call to `Factor()`. This allows us to treat a variable as factor, without having to modify it in the original data. For example, in the `mtcars` data, there is a binary numeric variable call `am`. We nest statistics within categories of `am` by typing:

```{r}
datasummary(mpg + hp ~ Factor(am) * (mean + sd),
            data = mtcars)
```

## `Arguments`: `na.rm=TRUE`

We can pass any argument to the summary function by including a call to `Arguments()`. For instance, there are missing values in the `flipper_length_mm` variable of the `penguins` dataset. Therefore, the standard `mean` function will produce no result, because its default argument is `na.rm=FALSE`. We can change that by calling:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ mean + mean*Arguments(na.rm=TRUE),
            data = penguins)
```

Notice that there is an empty cell (`NA`) under the normal `mean` function, but that the `mean` call with `Arguments(na.rm=TRUE)` produced a numeric result.

We can pass the same arguments to multiple functions using the parentheses:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ (mean + sd) * Arguments(na.rm=TRUE),
            data = penguins)
```

Note that the shortcut functions that `modelsummary` supplies use `na.rm=TRUE` by default, so we can use them directly without arguments, even when there are missing values:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Mean + Var + P75 + Range,
            data = penguins)
```

## `Arguments`: Weighted Mean

You can use the `Arguments` mechanism to do various things, such as calculating weighted means:

```{r}
newdata <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(20),
  w = rnorm(20),
  y = rnorm(20))

datasummary(x + y ~ weighted.mean * Arguments(w = w),
            data = newdata, output = "markdown")
```

Which produces the same results as:

```{r}
weighted.mean(newdata$x, newdata$w)
weighted.mean(newdata$y, newdata$w)
```

But different results from:

```{r}
mean(newdata$x)
mean(newdata$y)
```

## Empty cells

Sometimes, if we nest too much and the dataset is not large/diverse enough, we end up with empty cells. In that case, we add `*DropEmpty()` to the formula:

```{r}
datasummary(island * species * body_mass_g ~ sex * (Mean + SD),
            data = penguins)
datasummary(island * species * body_mass_g ~ sex * (Mean + SD) * DropEmpty(),
            data = penguins)
```

## Logical subsets

Cool stuff is possible with logical subsets:

```{r}
datasummary((bill_length_mm > 44.5) + (bill_length_mm <= 44.5) ~ Mean * flipper_length_mm,
            data = penguins)
```

See the `tables` package documentation for more details and examples.

# output

All functions in the `datasummary_*` family accept the same `output` argument. Tables can be saved to several file formats:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
f <- flipper_length_mm ~ island * (mean + sd)
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.html')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.tex')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.docx')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.pptx')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.md')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.rtf')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.jpg')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.png')
```

They can be returned in human-readable data.frames, markdown, html, or LaTeX code to the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'data.frame')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'markdown')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'html')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'latex')
```

`datasummary` can return objects compatible with the `gt`, `kableExtra`, `flextable`, and `huxtable` table creation and customization packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'gt')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'kableExtra')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'flextable')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'huxtable')
```

Please note that hierarchical or "nested" column labels are only available for these output formats: kableExtra, gt, html, rtf, and LaTeX. When saving tables to other formats, nested labels will be combined to a "flat" header.

# fmt

The `fmt` argument allows us to set the printing format of numeric values. It accepts a single number representing the number of digits after the period, or a string to be passed to the `sprintf` function. For instance, setting `fmt="%.4f"` will keep 4 digits after the dot (see `?sprintf` for more options):

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Mean + SD,
            fmt = 4,
            data = penguins)
```

We can set the formatting on a term-by-term basis by using the same `Arguments` function that we used to handle missing values in the previous section. The shortcut functions that ship with `modelsummary` (e.g., `Mean`, `SD`, `Median`, `P25`) all include a `fmt` argument:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Mean * Arguments(fmt = "%.4f") + SD * Arguments(fmt = "%.1f"),
            data = penguins)
```

If we do *not* want `datasummary` to format numbers, and we want to keep the numerical values instead of formatted strings, set `fmt=NULL`. This can be useful when post-processing tables with packages like `gt`, which allow us to transform cells based on their numerical content (this `gt` table will be omitted from PDF output):

```{r, eval = !knitr::is_latex_output()}
library(gt)

datasummary(All(mtcars) ~ Mean + SD,
            data = mtcars,
            fmt = NULL,
            output = 'gt') %>%
    tab_style(style = cell_fill(color = "pink"),
              locations = cells_body(rows = Mean > 10, columns = 2))
```

# title, notes

`datasummary` includes the same `title` and `notes` arguments as in `modelsummary`:

```{r}
datasummary(All(penguins) ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins,
            title = 'Statistics about the famous Palmer Penguins.',
            notes = c('A note at the bottom of the table.'))
```

# align

We can align columns using the `align` argument. `align` should be a string of length equal to the number of columns, and which includes only the letters "l",
"c", or "r":

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm ~ Mean + SD + Range,
            data = penguins,
            align = 'lrcl')
```

# add_rows

```{r}
new_rows <- data.frame('Does',
                       2,
                       'plus',
                       2,
                       'equals',
                       5,
                       '?')
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ species * (Mean + SD),
            data = penguins,
            add_rows = new_rows)
```

# add_columns

```{r}
new_cols <- data.frame('New Stat' = runif(2))
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ species * (Mean + SD),
            data = penguins,
            add_columns = new_cols)
```

# Histograms

The `datasummary` family of functions allow users to display in-line spark-style histograms to describe the distribution of the variables. For example, the `datasummary_skim` produces such a histogram:

```{r}
tmp <- mtcars[, c("mpg", "hp")]
datasummary_skim(tmp)
```

Each of the histograms in the table above is actually an SVG image, produced by the `kableExtra` package. For this reason, the histogram will *not* appear when users use a different output backend, such as `gt`, `flextable`, or `huxtable`.

The `datasummary` function is incredibly flexible, but it does not include a histogram option by default. Here is a simple example of how one can customize the output of `datasummary`. We proceed in 4 steps:

1. Normalize the variables and store them in a list 
2. Create the table with `datasummary`, making sure to include 2 "empty" columns. In the example, we use a simple function called `emptycol` to fill those columns with empty strings.
3. Add the histograms or boxplots using functions from the `kableExtra` package.

```{r}
library(kableExtra)

tmp <- mtcars[, c("mpg", "hp")]

# create a list with individual variables
# remove missing and rescale
tmp_list <- lapply(tmp, na.omit)
tmp_list <- lapply(tmp_list, scale)

# create a table with `datasummary`
# add a histogram with column_spec and spec_hist
# add a boxplot with colun_spec and spec_box
emptycol = function(x) " "
datasummary(mpg + hp ~ Mean + SD + Heading("Boxplot") * emptycol + Heading("Histogram") * emptycol, data = tmp) %>%
    column_spec(column = 4, image = spec_boxplot(tmp_list)) %>%
    column_spec(column = 5, image = spec_hist(tmp_list))
```

If you want a simpler solution, you can try the `Histogram` function which works in `datasummary` automatically and comes bundled with `modelsummary`. The downside of this function is that it uses Unicode characters to create the histogram. This kind of histogram may not display well with certain typefaces or on some operating systems (Windows!).

```{r}
datasummary(mpg + hp ~ Mean + SD + Histogram, data = tmp)
```

# Missing values

At least 3 distinct issues can arise related to missing values.

## Functions and `na.rm`

An empty cell can appear in the table when a statistical function returns `NA` instead of a numeric value. In those cases, you should:

1. Make sure that your statistical function (e.g., `mean` or `sd`) uses `na.rm=TRUE` by default
2. Use the `Arguments` strategy to set `na.rm=TRUE` (see the `Arguments` section of this vignette).
3. Use a convenience function supplied by `modelsummary`, where `na.rm` is `TRUE` by default: `Mean`, `SD`, `P25`, etc.

## Empty crosstab cells

An empty cell can appear in the table when a crosstab is deeply nested, and there are no observations for a given combination of covariates. In those cases, you can use the `* DropEmpty` pseudo-function. See the "Empty cells" section of this vignette for examples.

## Factors

By default, the `factor` function in `R` does *not* assign a distinct factor level to missing values: the `factor` function's `exclude` argument is set to `NA` by default. To ensure that `NA`s appear in your table, make sure you set `exclude=NULL` when you create the factor.

Internally, the `datasummary_balance` and `datasummary_crosstab` functions convert logical and character variables to factor with the `exclude=NULL` argument. This means that `NA`s will appear in the table as distinct rows/columns. If you do *not* want `NA`s to appear in your table, convert them to factors yourself ahead of time. For example:

```{r}
mycars <- mtcars[, c("cyl", "mpg", "hp", "vs")]
mycars$cyl[c(1, 3, 6, 8)] <- NA
mycars$cyl_nona <- factor(mycars$cyl)
mycars$cyl_na <- factor(mycars$cyl, exclude = NULL)

datasummary_crosstab(cyl_nona ~ vs, data = mycars)
datasummary_crosstab(cyl_na ~ vs, data = mycars)
```

# Appearance

In the [Appearance Vignette](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/appearance.html) we saw how to customize the tables produced by the `modelsummary` function. The same customization possibilities are also available for all functions in the `datasummary_*` family of functions. Indeed, we can customize the tables produced by `datasummary` using the functions provided by `gt`, `kableExtra`, `flextable`, and `huxtable`. For instance, to customize tables using `kableExtra`, we can do:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins$sex <- str_to_title(penguins$sex)
```

```{r}
library(kableExtra)

# Convert to `data.frame` to circumvent a `tibbles`-related bug in `All()`
# https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary/issues/395
penguins <- data.frame(penguins)

datasummary(All(penguins) ~ sex * (Mean + SD),
            data = penguins,
            output = 'kableExtra') %>%
  row_spec(3, background = 'cyan', color = 'red')
```

To customize a table using the `gt` package, we can:

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
library(gt)

adelie <- function(x) web_image('https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987057/85402702-20b1d280-b52a-11ea-9950-f3a03133fd45.png', height = 100)
gentoo <- function(x) web_image('https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987057/85402718-27404a00-b52a-11ea-9ad3-dd7562f6438d.png', height = 100)
chinstrap <- function(x) web_image('https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987057/85402708-23acc300-b52a-11ea-9a77-de360a0d1f7d.png', height = 100)

cap <- 'Flipper lengths (mm) of the famous penguins of Palmer Station, Antarctica.'
f <- (`Species` = species) ~ (` ` = flipper_length_mm) * (`Distribution` = Histogram) + flipper_length_mm * sex * ((`Avg.` = Mean)*Arguments(fmt='%.0f') + (`Std. Dev.` = SD)*Arguments(fmt='%.1f'))
datasummary(f,
            data = penguins,
            output = 'gt',
            title = cap,
            notes = 'Artwork by @allison_horst',
            sparse_header = TRUE) %>%
    text_transform(locations = cells_body(columns = 1, rows = 1), fn = adelie) %>%
    text_transform(locations = cells_body(columns = 1, rows = 2), fn = chinstrap) %>%
    text_transform(locations = cells_body(columns = 1, rows = 3), fn = gentoo) %>%
    tab_style(style = list(cell_text(color = "#FF6700", size = 'x-large')), locations = cells_body(rows = 1)) %>%
    tab_style(style = list(cell_text(color = "#CD51D1", size = 'x-large')), locations = cells_body(rows = 2)) %>%
    tab_style(style = list(cell_text(color = "#007377", size = 'x-large')), locations = cells_body(rows = 3)) %>%
    tab_options(table_body.hlines.width = 0, table.border.top.width = 0, table.border.bottom.width = 0) %>%
    cols_align('center', columns = 3:6)
```
