`datasummary` is a function from the `modelsummary` package. It allows you to create data summaries, frequency tables, crosstabs, correlation tables, "Table 1s," and more. It has many benefits:

* Easy to use.
* *Extremely* flexible.
* Many output formats: HTML, LaTeX, Microsoft Word and Powerpoint, Text/Markdown, PDF, RTF, or Image files.
* Embed tables in `Rmarkdown` or `knitr` dynamic documents.
* [Customize the appearance of your tables](#customize) with the `gt`, `kableExtra` or `flextable` packages. The possibilities are endless!

This tutorial will show you how to draw tables like these (and more!):

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(modelsummary)
library(kableExtra)
options(modelsummary_default = 'kableExtra')
options(width = 120)
```

# Background

`datasummary` is built around the *fantastic* [`tables` package for `R`.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tables/index.html) It is a thin "wrapper" which adds convenience functions and arguments; a user-interface consistent with `modelsummary`; cleaner html output; and the ability to export tables to more formats, including [`gt` tables](https://gt.rstudio.com), [`flextable` objects](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/), and Microsoft Word documents. 

`datasummary` is a general-purpose table-making tool. It allows you to build (nearly) any summary table you want by using [simple 2-sided formulae.](#datasummary) For example, in the expression `x + y ~ mean + sd`, the left-hand side of the formula identifies the variables or statistics to display as rows, and the right-hand side defines the columns. Below, we will see how variables and statistics can be "nested" with the `*` operator to produce tables like the ones above.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(modelsummary)
library(tidyverse)

cap <- 'Penguin flipper lengths (mm) by location, species, and sex. This table was created using the \\texttt{datasummary} function from the modelsummary package for R.'
src <- 'Data source: Gorman, Williams & Fraser (2014) and  palmerpenguins package by @allison_horst.'
url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/palmerpenguins/penguins.csv'
penguins <- read.csv(url) %>%
            select(Species = species,
                   Island = island,
                   Sex = sex,
                   `Flipper length (mm)` = flipper_length_mm) %>%
            mutate(Sex = str_to_title(Sex))
datasummary(Factor(Island) * Factor(Species) ~ Factor(Sex) * `Flipper length (mm)` * (Mean + SD) * DropEmpty(), penguins,
           title = cap,
           notes = src)
```

In addition to `datasummary`, the `modelsummary` package includes a "family" of companion functions named `datasummary_*`. These functions facilitate the production of standard, commonly used tables. This family currently includes:

* `datasummary()`: Flexible function to create custom tables using 2-sided formulae.
* `datasummary_skim()`: Quick summary of your dataset.
* `datasummary_correlation()`: Table of correlations.
* `datasummary_table1()`: Group characteristics (e.g., control vs. treatment)

In the next three sections, we illustrate how to use `datasummary_skim`, `datasummary_correlation`, and `datasummary_table1`. Then, we dive into `datasummary` itself to highlight its ease and flexibility.

# `datasummary_skim`

The first `datasummary` companion function is called `datasummary_skim`. It was *heavily* inspired by one of my favorite data exploration tools for `R`: the [`skimr` package.](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr) The goal of this function is to give you a quick look at the data. 

To illustrate, we download data from the cool new [`palmerpenguins` package](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) by Allison Horst. These data were collected at the Palmer Station in Antarctica by Gorman, Williams & Fraser (2014), and they include 3 categorical variables and 4 numeric variables.

```{r}
library(modelsummary)
library(tidyverse)

url <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/palmerpenguins/penguins.csv'
penguins <- read.csv(url)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins$X <- NULL
```

To summarize the numeric variables in the dataset, we type:

```{r}
datasummary_skim(penguins, histogram = TRUE)
```

To summarize the categorical variables in the dataset, we type:

```{r}
datasummary_skim(penguins, 'categorical')
```

Later in this tutorial, it will become clear that `datasummary_skim` is just a convenience "template" built around `datasummary`, since we can achieve identical results with the latter. For example, to produce a text-only version of the tables above, we can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datasummary(All(penguins) ~ Mean + SD + Histogram, 
            data = penguins, 
            output = 'markdown')
```

```
|                  |Mean    |SD     |Histogram      
|:-----------------|:-------|:------|:--------------
|culmen_length_mm  |43.9    |5.5    |▁▅▆▆▆▇▇▂▁      
|culmen_depth_mm   |17.2    |2.0    |▃▄▄▄▇▆▇▅▂▁     
|flipper_length_mm |200.9   |14.1   |▂▅▇▄▁▄▄▂▁      
|body_mass_g       |4201.8  |802.0  |▁▄▇▅▄▄▃▃▂▁     
```

Note that the `histogram` argument of the `datasummary_skim` function is `FALSE` by default, because printing histograms will not work on all computers. If you have issues with this option, try to change your computer's locale, or try using a different display font.

# `datasummary_correlation`

The `datasummary_correlation` accepts a dataframe or tibble, it identifies all the numeric variables, and calculates the correlation between each of those variables:

```{r}
datasummary_correlation(mtcars)
```

The values displayed in this table are equivalent to those obtained by calling: `cor(x, use='pairwise.complete.obs')`.

# `datasummary_table1`

The expression "Table 1" refers to a particular style of table which is often printed in the opening pages of a scientific peer reviewed article. Typically, this table will include basic descriptive statistics about different subsets of the study population. For instance, analysts may want to display the socio-demographic characteristics of members of the Control and Treatement groups in a randomized control trial, or the flipper length and male and female penguins.

To illustrate how to build a Table 1 using the `datasummary_table1` function, we download data about a job training experiment studies in Lalonde (1986). Then, we clean up the data by renaming and recoding a few variables. 

```{r}
# Download and read data
training <- 'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/Treatment.csv' 
training <- read.csv(training)

# Rename and recode variables
training <- training %>%
            mutate(`Earnings pre-treatment (1,000USD)` = re75 / 1000,
                   `Earnings post-treatment (1,000USD)` = re78 / 1000,
                   Treatment = ifelse(treat == TRUE, 'Treatment', 'Control'),
                   Married = ifelse(married == TRUE, 'Yes', 'No')) %>%
            select(`Earnings pre-treatment (1,000USD)`,
                   `Earnings post-treatment (1,000USD)`, 
                   Treatment, 
                   Ethnicity = ethn, 
                   Age = age, 
                   Education = educ, 
                   Married)

head(training)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
caption <- 'Descriptive statistics about participants in a job training experiment. This table was created using the "datasummary" function from the "modelsummary" package for R.'
reference <- 'Source: Lalonde (1986) American Economic Review.'

library(modelsummary)
datasummary_table1(~Treatment, 
                   data = training,
                   title = caption,
                   notes = reference)
```

# `datasummary`

`datasummary` tables are specified using a 2-sided formula, divided by a tilde `~`. The left-hand side describes the rows; the right-hand side describes the columns. To illustrate how this works, we will again be using the [`palmerpenguins dataset`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/):

To display the `flipper_length_mm` variable as a row and the `mean` as a column, we type:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Mean, 
            data = penguins)
```

To flip rows and columns, we flip the left and right-hand sides of the formula:

```{r}
datasummary(Mean ~ flipper_length_mm, 
            data = penguins)
```

The `Mean` function is a shortcut supplied by `modelsummary`, and it is equivalent to `mean(x,na.rm=TRUE)`. Since the `flipper_length_mm` variable includes missing observation, using the `mean` formula (with default `na.rm=FALSE`) would produce a missing/empty cell:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ mean, 
            data = penguins)
```

`modelsummary` supplies these functions: `Mean`, `SD`, `Min`, `Max`, `Median`, `P0`, `P25`, `P50`, `P75`, `P100`, `Histogram`, and a few more (see the package documentation). 

Users are also free to create and use their own custom summaries. Any `R` function which takes a vector and produces a single value is acceptable. For example, the `Range` functions return a numerical value, and the `MinMax` returns a string:

```{r}
Range <- function(x) max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)

datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Range, 
            data = penguins)

MinMax <- function(x) paste0('[', min(x, na.rm = TRUE), ', ', max(x, na.rm = TRUE), ']')

datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ MinMax, 
            data = penguins)
```

# Concatenating with `+`

To include more rows and columns, we use the `+` sign:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins)
```

Sometimes, it can be cumbersome to list all variables separated by `+` signs. The `All()` function is a useful shortcut:

```{r}
datasummary(All(penguins) ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins)
```
By default, `All` selects all numeric variables. This behavior can be changed by modifying the function's arguments. See `?All` for details.

# Nesting categorical variables with `*`

`datasummary` can nest variables and statistics inside categorical variables using the `*` symbol. When applying the the `*` operator to factor, character, or logical variables, columns or rows will automatically be nested. For instance, if we want to display separate means for each value of the variable `sex`, we use `mean * sex`:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ mean * sex, 
            data = penguins)
```

We can use parentheses to nest several terms inside one another, using a call of this form: `x * (y + z)`. Here is an example with nested columns:

```{r}
datasummary(body_mass_g ~ sex * (mean + sd), 
            data = penguins)
```

Here is an example with nested rows:

```{r}
datasummary(sex * (body_mass_g + flipper_length_mm) ~ mean + sd, 
            data = penguins)
```

The order in which terms enter the formula determines the order in which labels are displayed. For example, this shows `island` above `sex`:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ mean * island * sex,
            data = penguins)
```

This shows `sex` above `island` values:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ mean * sex * island,
            data = penguins)
```

By default, `datasummary` omits column headers with a single value/label across all columns, except for the header that sits just above the data. If the header you want to see is not displayed, you may want to reorder the terms of your formula. To show all headers, set `sparse_header=FALSE`:
  
```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ mean * sex * island,
            data = penguins,
            sparse_header = FALSE)
```

When using `sparse_header=FALSE`, it is often useful to insert `Heading() *` in the table formula, in order to rename or omit some of the labels manually. Type `?tables::Heading` for details and examples.

# Renaming with `=`

Personally, I prefer to rename variables and values *before* drawing my tables, using backticks when variable names include whitespace. For example,

```{r}
tmp <- penguins %>% 
       select(`Flipper length (mm)` = flipper_length_mm,
              `Body mass (g)` = body_mass_g)

datasummary(`Flipper length (mm)` + `Body mass (g)` ~ Mean + SD,
            data = tmp)
```

However, thanks to the `tables` package, `datasummary` offers two additional mechanisms to rename. First, you can wrap a term in parentheses and use the equal `=` sign: `(NewName=OldName)`: 

```{r}
datasummary((`Flipper length (mm)` = flipper_length_mm) + (`Body mass (g)` = body_mass_g) ~ 
            island * ((Avg. = Mean) + (Std.Dev. = SD)), 
            data = penguins)
```

Second, we can use the `Heading()` function:

```{r}
datasummary(Heading("Flipper length (mm)") * flipper_length_mm + Heading("Body mass (g)") * body_mass_g ~ island * (Mean + SD), 
            data = penguins)
```

The `Heading` function also has a `nearData` argument which can be useful in cases where some rows are nested but others are not. Compare the last row of these two tables:

```{r}
datasummary(sex * (flipper_length_mm + culmen_length_mm) + Heading("Body mass (g)") * body_mass_g ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins)

datasummary(sex * (flipper_length_mm + culmen_length_mm) + Heading("Body mass (g)", nearData=FALSE) * body_mass_g ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins)
```

# Counts and Percentages

The `tables` package allows `datasummary` to use a neat tricks to produce frequency tables:

1. Add a `1` to the right-hand side of the equation and rename it: `(N = 1)`. 
2. Add `Percent()` to the right-hand side to calculate the percentage of observations in each cell.
3. Add `1` to the left-hand side to include a row with the total number of observations:

```{r}
datasummary(species * sex + 1 ~ (N = 1) + Percent(),
            data = penguins)
```

Note that the `Percent()` function accepts a `denom` argument to determine if percentages should be calculated row or column-wise, or if they should take into account all cells.

# `Arguments`: Missing values

You can pass any argument to your summary function by including a call to `Arguments()`. For instance, there are missing values in the `flipper_length_mm` variable of the `penguins` dataset. Therefore, the standard `mean` function will produce no result, because its default argument is `na.rm=FALSE`. We can change that by calling:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ mean + mean*Arguments(na.rm=TRUE),
            data = penguins)
```

Notice that there is an empty cell (`NA`) under the normal `mean` function, but that the `mean` call with `Arguments(na.rm=TRUE)` produced a numeric result.

You can pass the same arguments to muliple functions using the parentheses:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ (mean + sd) * Arguments(na.rm=TRUE),
            data = penguins)
```

Note that the shortcut functions that `modelsummary` supplies use `na.rm=TRUE` by default, so you can use them directly without arguments, even when there are missing values:

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Mean + Var + P75 + Range,
            data = penguins)
```

# Rounding

The `fmt` argument allows you to set the printing format of numeric values. For instance, setting `fmt="%.4f"` will keep 4 digits after the period (see `?sprintf` for more options):

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Mean + SD,
            fmt = "%.4f",
            data = penguins)
```

You can set the formatting on a term-by-term basis by using the same `Arguments` function that we used to handle missing values in the previous section. The shortcut functions that ship with `modelsummary` (e.g., `Mean`, `SD`, `Median`, `P25`) all include a `fmt` argument: 

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm ~ Mean * Arguments(fmt = "%.4f") + SD * Arguments(fmt = "%.1f"),
            data = penguins)
```

If you do *not* want `datasummary` to format numbers, and you want to keep the numerical values instead of formatted strings, set `fmt=NULL`. This can be useful when post-processing tables with packages like `gt`, which allow you to transform cells based on their numerical content:

```{r}
library(gt)

datasummary(All(mtcars) ~ Mean + SD, 
            data = mtcars, 
            fmt = NULL, 
            output = 'gt') %>%
    tab_style(style = cell_fill(color = "pink"), 
              locations = cells_body(rows = Mean > 10, columns = 2))
```

# `Factor`

The `*` nesting operator that we used above works automatically for factor, character, and logical variables. Sometimes, it is convenient to use it with other types of variables, such as binary numeric variables. In that case, we can wrap the variable name inside a call to `Factor()`. This allows us to treat a variable as factor, without having to modify it in the original data. For example, in the `mtcars` data, there is a binary numeric variable call `am`. We nest statistics within categories of `am` by typing:

```{r}
datasummary(mpg + hp ~ Factor(am) * (mean + sd),
            data = mtcars)
```


# Empty cells in crosstabs

Sometimes, if we nest too much and the dataset is not large/diverse enough, we end up with empty cells. In that case, we add `*DropEmpty()` to the formula:

```{r}
datasummary(island * species * body_mass_g ~ sex * (Mean + SD), 
            data = penguins)
datasummary(island * species * body_mass_g ~ sex * (Mean + SD) * DropEmpty(), 
            data = penguins)
```

# Logical subsets

Cool stuff is possible with logical subsets:

```{r}
datasummary((culmen_length_mm > 44.5) + (culmen_length_mm <= 44.5) ~ Mean * flipper_length_mm, 
            data = penguins)
```

See the `tables` package documentation for more details and examples.

# Titles and notes

`datasummary` includes the same `title` and `notes` arguments as in `modelsummary`:

```{r}
datasummary(All(penguins) ~ Mean + SD,
            data = penguins,
            title = 'Statistics about the famous Palmer Penguins.',
            notes = c('A note at the bottom of the table.'))
```

# Align columns

You can align columns using the `align` argument. `align` should be a string of length equal to the number of columns, and which includes only the letters "l", 
"c", or "r":

```{r}
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + culmen_length_mm ~ Mean + SD + Range,
            data = penguins,
            align = 'lrcl')
```

# `add_columns` and `add_rows`

```{r}
new_rows <- data.frame('Does',
                       2,
                       'plus',
                       2,
                       'equals',
                       5,
                       '?')
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ species * (Mean + SD),
            data = penguins,
            add_rows = new_rows)

```{r}
new_cols <- data.frame('New Stat' = runif(2))
datasummary(flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g ~ species * (Mean + SD),
            data = penguins,
            add_columns = new_cols)
```



# Save and Display

`datasummary` can save tables to several file formats, using the `output` argument:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
f <- flipper_length_mm ~ island * (mean + sd)
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.html')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.tex')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.docx')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.pptx')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.md')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.rtf')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.jpg')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'table.png')
```

`datasummary` can return human-readable markdown, html, or LaTeX code to the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'markdown')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'html')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'latex')
```

`datasummary` can return objects compatible with the `gt`, `kableExtra`, `flextable`, and `huxtable` table creation and customization packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'gt')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'kableExtra')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'flextable')
datasummary(f, data = penguins, output = 'huxtable')
```

Please note that hierarchical or "nested" column labels are only available for these output formats: kableExtra, gt, html, rtf, and LaTeX. When saving tables to other formats, nested labels will be combined to a "flat" header.

# Customize

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins$sex <- str_to_title(penguins$sex)
```

You can customize the tables produced by `datasummary` using the functions provided by `gt`, `kableExtra`, `flextable`, and `huxtable`. For instance, to customize tables using `kableExtra`, we can do:

```{r}
library(kableExtra)

datasummary(All(penguins) ~ sex * (Mean + SD),
            data = penguins,
            output = 'kableExtra') %>%
  row_spec(3, background = 'cyan', color = 'red')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
library(gt)
