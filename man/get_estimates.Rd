\title{Extract model estimates in a tidy format.}
\usage{
get_estimates(
  model,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  vcov = NULL,
  shape = NULL,
  coef_rename = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a single model object}

\item{conf_level}{numeric value between 0 and 1. confidence level to use for
confidence intervals. Setting this argument to \code{NULL} does not extract
confidence intervals, which can be faster for some models.}

\item{vcov}{robust standard errors and other manual statistics. The \code{vcov}
argument accepts six types of input (see the 'Details' and 'Examples'
sections below):
\itemize{
\item NULL returns the default uncertainty estimates of the model object
\item string, vector, or (named) list of strings. "iid", "classical", and "constant" are aliases for \code{NULL}, which returns the model's default uncertainty estimates. The strings "HC", "HC0", "HC1" (alias: "stata"), "HC2", "HC3" (alias: "robust"), "HC4", "HC4m", "HC5", "HAC", "NeweyWest", "Andrews", "panel-corrected", "outer-product", and "weave" use variance-covariance matrices computed using functions from the \code{sandwich} package, or equivalent method. The behavior of those functions can (and sometimes \emph{must}) be altered by passing arguments to \code{sandwich} directly from \code{modelsummary} through the ellipsis (\code{...}), but it is safer to define your own custom functions as described in the next bullet.
\item function or (named) list of functions which return variance-covariance matrices with row and column names equal to the names of your coefficient estimates (e.g., \code{stats::vcov}, \code{sandwich::vcovHC}, \code{function(x) vcovPC(x, cluster="country")}).
\item formula or (named) list of formulas with the cluster variable(s) on the right-hand side (e.g., ~clusterid).
\item named list of \code{length(models)} variance-covariance matrices with row and column names equal to the names of your coefficient estimates.
\item a named list of length(models) vectors with names equal to the names of your coefficient estimates. See 'Examples' section below. Warning: since this list of vectors can include arbitrary strings or numbers, \code{modelsummary} cannot automatically calculate p values. The \code{stars} argument may thus use incorrect significance thresholds when \code{vcov} is a list of vectors.
}}

\item{shape}{formula which determines the shape of the table. The left side
determines what appears on rows, and the right side determines what appears
on columns. The formula can include a group identifier to display related terms
together, which can be useful for models with multivariate outcomes or
grouped coefficients (See examples section below). This identifier must be
one of the column names produced by: \code{get_estimates(model)}. The group
identifier can be combined with the term identifier in a single column by
using the colon to represent an interaction. If an incomplete formula is
supplied (e.g., \code{~statistic}), \code{modelsummary} tries to complete it
automatically. Potential \code{shape} values include:
\itemize{
\item \code{term + statistic ~ model}: default
\item \code{term ~ model + statistic}: statistics in separate columns
\item \code{model + statistic ~ term}: models in rows and terms in columns
\item \code{term + response + statistic ~ model}: term and group id in separate columns
\item \code{term : response + statistic ~ model}: term and group id in a single column
\item \code{term ~ response}
}}

\item{coef_rename}{named character vector or function
\itemize{
\item Named character vector: Values refer to the variable names that will appear in the table. Names refer to the original term names stored in the model object. Ex: c("hp:mpg"="hp X mpg")
\item Function: Accepts a character vector of the model's term names and returns a named vector like the one described above. The \code{modelsummary} package supplies a \code{coef_rename()} function which can do common cleaning tasks: \code{modelsummary(model, coef_rename = coef_rename)}
}}

\item{...}{all other arguments are passed through to three functions. See the documentation of these functions for lists of available arguments.
\itemize{
\item \link[parameters:model_parameters]{parameters::model_parameters} extracts parameter estimates.
\item \link[performance:model_performance]{performance::model_performance} extracts goodness-of-fit statistics.
\item \link[kableExtra:kbl]{kableExtra::kbl} or \link[gt:gt]{gt::gt} draw tables, depending on the value of the \code{output} argument.
}}
}
\description{
This is a mostly internal function which could be useful to users who want
a unified approach to extract results from a wide variety of models. For
some models \code{get_estimates} attaches useful attributes to the output. You
can access this information by calling the \code{attributes} function:
\code{attributes(get_estimates(model))}
}
