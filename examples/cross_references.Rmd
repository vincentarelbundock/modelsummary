title: Cross-references with `Rmarkdown`, `bookdown` and `modelsummary`
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    toc: false
---

The `bookdown` package allows you to compile PDF documents with table numbers and cross references. To do this, you must include a title in your table, use the `\@ref{tab:name}` construct, and give a name to the `R` chunk where `modelsummary` is called. 

For example, see Table \@ref(tab:test).

```{r test}
library(modelsummary)
mod <- lm(hp ~ mpg, mtcars)
modelsummary(mod, title = 'This title describes the content of this table.')
```
